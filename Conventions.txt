This is a basic file containing conventions to use when submitting your code to PyMaterial Project. These
guidelines would also be helpful if one wants to read the code of PyMaterial project. These
are good conventions to follow when making projects using PyMaterial Framework because these conventions
are mostly followed internally in framework.

-> All the instance variables of classes should prefix i to the name, i.e. iDuration, iWidth
-> No prefix for private instance variables of classes.
-> All the static variables of classes should prefix s to the name, i.e. sSample, sStaticVariable
-> Code should be written according to PEP8 standards. (Optional)
-> Documentation of method should be given immediately after the method start and should be in block(Three quoted)
   comment.
-> Documentation given inside the method, i.e. for variables and loops, should be given by single line
   comments.
-> Links to other classes and methods of same or different classes should be enclosed in curly brackets({})
   and should be prefixed by @link annotation.
-> Other things which might be of interest of the reader should be written at the end of method documentation
   with the @see annotation prefixed to the class or method name.
-> Links to other classes and methods of project should be given from the root of the project if reasonably
   important.
-> When using @see or @link, use direct name for method if the method is of same class and use direct name of
   class if the class is of same package. Otherwise try to use fully qualified names.
